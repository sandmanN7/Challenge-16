# Challenge-16

The purpose of this project is to compare and contrast the quantity and quality of the paid and unpaid review categories for a specific category of products on Amazon.

For the unpaid reviews of products with a total number of votes 20 and over:

- There are a total of 1685 reviews

- Out of those reviews, 631 are five-star reviews.

- Approximately 37.4% of all reviews had five-star ratings.

- There are no paid reviews for the digital video game product category.

## Summary

There are no paid reviews in this product category, therefore, there is no bias to determine from this data set. Thus, a proposal for a data analysis would be to get paid reviews for digital video games, if that data could be made, then, assuming there is a bias, seeing if the bias comes from video-game developers with larger market shares.
